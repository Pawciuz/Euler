## Euler's Method app

An application that solves differential equations modeling the motion of a pendulum using the numerical Euler's Method.

- Choose the order of the method (1st, 2st, 4st)
- Enter parameters: End time (Czas konc), Initial Angle (Kąt początkowy), Initial angular velocity (Predkosc pocz).
- Choose a place to show or save the solution. (To the right panel, to the console, to the file 'result.txt' in project's root directory)
- Solve equation by clicking Options (Opcje) and Start Solving (Start obliczeń)
